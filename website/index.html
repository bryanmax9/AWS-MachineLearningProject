          <p>
            Sea turtles are fascinating and ancient mariners of the ocean,
            having graced our waters for millions of years. Their life cycle
            begins in a remarkable journey where females laboriously crawl onto
            sandy beaches to lay their eggs. Each nest, a cradle of life, can
            contain up to a hundred eggs, but not all will survive. After
            incubation, tiny hatchlings emerge and scramble towards the sea,
            guided by the natural light horizon over the ocean. This first
            journey is perilous, as seagulls and crabs often prey on these
            vulnerable newborns, drastically reducing their chances of survival.
            But the challenges for sea turtles don't end there. Human activities
            have introduced new threats, from plastic pollution and fishing nets
            in the oceans to artificial lighting on beaches, which can disorient
            hatchlings, leading them away from the sea. Coastal development has
            also resulted in the loss of nesting habitats. Remarkably, sea
            turtles play a crucial role in maintaining the health of marine
            ecosystems. For instance, their grazing helps maintain healthy
            seagrass beds and coral reefs, benefiting countless other marine
            species. Protecting sea turtles, therefore, is not just about saving
            an iconic species but also about preserving the balance of our
            marine environments. Every effort to reduce our environmental impact
            and safeguard their nesting sites contributes significantly to the
            survival of these incredible creatures.
